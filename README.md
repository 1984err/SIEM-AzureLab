# SIEM-Azure Lab

The purpose of this lab was to sharpen my skills and deepen my understanding 
of SIEMs (System Incident and Event Monitoring) by simulating an attack in an 
enterprise lab environment. I have chosen Kibana as my SIEM for this project 
but have also implemented the entire ELK within my network.  This project was 
done using a lab that I built within Azureâ€™s cloud environment. This lab 
touches on the following aspects of security and Information Technology:

SIEM & Alerts \
Pen-testing \
Mitigation & Hardening \ 
Docker \
ELK Stack \
Webdav \
Metasploit \
Hydra \ 
RCE \
Etc


This lab is for educational purposes only.
